			<p>Kappa Theta Pi is a professional fraternity that is heavily invested in technology. At the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology chapter, members must have a major, minor, or extreme interest in computing technology. We hold professional seminars for our members in order for them to network and gain important technical skills. Though we are young, we have a strong sense of brotherhood and host both social and professional events.</p>

			<p>At Rose-Hulman, KTP is especially interested in running these types of professional workshops:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>PLC Scheme Crash Course</li>
					<li>Soldering Crash Course</li>
					<li>Entrepreneurship Lectures</li>
					<li>Talks given by professionals who work in the field</li>
					<li>Interview Skills Workshop</li>
					<li>etc</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>If you think this would look good on your resume and it'd be fun to attend these events with friends, consider rushing Kappa Theta Pi during the winter term!</p>
